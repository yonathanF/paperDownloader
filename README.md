# paperDownloader
Downloads research papers from arXiv using a yaml config file that specifies topics, number of papers, and where the pdfs should be saved (among other things). The long term goal is to have a system that everyday at 6am downloads one research paper that's not already been downloaded. It will also update a Latex bib file for later citation. Might end up using MongoDb as a backend rather than just files and might add a 'print' feature.
